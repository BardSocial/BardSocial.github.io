This isn’t necessarily their goal but it is the reality. You subscribe to your musical friend on Twitch for $5 and Twitch takes $2.50 off the top. They also follow you and want to support your channel, because that’s what friends do, so they subscribe for $5 and Twitch takes $2.50 off the top. Now you’ve both lost $2.50 and Twitch has made $5.00. Creators generally hangout together and love supporting each other so this happens a lot.
