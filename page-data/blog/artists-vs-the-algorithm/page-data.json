The purpose of this is because popular posts, often measured by how much of an emotional response they can cause, are designed to sell things and to keep people active on the platform. Our emotions influence our buying behaviors and these platforms know that. Algorithmic platforms like twitter, instagram, and facebook make revenue off advertisements. Companies pay them money to showcase ads that hopefully sell their products and this only works if in fact the ads do sell products so the social media platforms have to be pretty good at it. One of the methods these platforms use is rewarding consistently posting accounts."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"d40fe77510e0","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"6a82732cc0ba","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"721aeb1ebd9f","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"ceb6811aa9040","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"One of the biggest gripes people have with social media is how often you have to post in order to be seen.
