To bootstrap a platform means to fund the platform through your own personal savings and revenue made from the platform itself. Bard is built in house, by me, along with all the marketing and outreach. One alternative would be to apply for an investment from venture capitalists (VC). Both of these approaches have their advantages and downfalls but we’re here to explain why it’s a good thing that we’re bootstrapping."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"When you apply to get funding from VC’s you’re only going to receive funding if the VC thinks you’re going to make money and the expectation is that you’re going to make that money back and more. In other words, no matter how ethical or helpful you want to be with what you’re creating, making money becomes the bottom line most important objective. If things begin to go poorly for a business it may be in the VC’s best interest to make their money back through any means necessary rather than continuing to pursue the original intention the founders had. You may even drop as low as creating or selling NFT art on your platform, the unique and special but infinitely reproducible pictures on the internet. This isn’t to say that some VC’s don’t have good intentions. A lot of people with that kind of money are interested in making the world a better place but they didn’t get rich by not making money back on their investments. This also isn’t to say that VC funded platforms always leave their values behind in the pursuit of money, plenty don’t."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"Bootstrapping on the other hand allows you to stick with your roots no matter what and it allows you to adapt quickly. If you, the reader, or the Bard community reaches out with ideas and requests we can decide to work on that starting today. If things get tough we can pick up other work to pay the bills. It’s certainly more difficult for bootstrapped platforms to conquer huge markets but it’s not difficult for them to solve real problems and to stick to the roots of why they started what they started. On top of that, there is plenty to be said about platforms that continue to put their users first. As long as we continue to make artists lives easier we are likely to thrive. With Bard we want to help artists create more engaging experiences with each other, help artists build communities, and create a platform that helps financially support artists. It’s our passion to create a place where creativity thrives, is experienced, and is appreciated and we are sticking to that."}]},{"children":[]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"The other benefit to bootstrapping Bard is that we don’t need to grow "},{"marks":["strong"],"text":"too"},{"marks":[],"text":" quickly. With funding, the expectation is that you’re trying to make money ASAP and with a community centric platform like Bard, growing too fast is a death sentence. Communities aren’t built through brute force. They’re built through patience and compassion. The fabric that holds a community together is built through discussion, time, and trust and there is no way to fast track that. This is a great time for me to share how grateful I am for the community around Bard. Many of you have been around through thick and thin as we’ve worked to understand the creative industry and on building and improving Bard. Without you, the creators and supporters, Bard would be nothing."}]}],"categories":[{"title":"Blog"}],"mainImage":null}},{"node":{"title":"Why artists should have a newsletter","publishedAt":"2022-06-28T16:11:00.000Z","preview":"In a world where many of the platforms we use are transient, it’s important for creators to have a complete list of their biggest fans, peers, and connections.

They exist now but one day they will not and even the audiences we build on these platforms will join and leave over time. While the downfall of Instagram, Twitter, DeviantArt, or ArtStation may seem impossible it will eventually happen and you should be able to stay in touch with your biggest fans, peers, and connections when that happens. Even Bard may eventually fall but let’s hope it’s decades into the future. A newsletter is a way for you to collect the emails from all the people who want to and are willing to stay up to date with everything you’re doing. If you open commissions, quit your job, start a new initiative, or are looking for work it’s a great way to share that news with the people who are most likely to care and be of help. If you share that news on social media and the algorithm dibs it unfavourable only 5 or 10% of your followers may even see it. Email lists on the other hand have an average of a 20% open rate but it’s possible to increase that with some consistent mail outs."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"So start an newsletter or at the very least an email list so that you can have a list of everyone who wants to follow you forever. These email platforms will always allow you to export your lists and download them onto your computer where you can then store them so that you never lose them. You could even start with a notepad and a pen but as long as you have a list of these emails in a place that isn’t going to disappear you’re safe. If you are planning on consistently mailing out to this list be sure to do some reading on what makes a good newsletter. While you may be used to posting on social media a few times a day, newsletters generally send things out way less often. Whenever you’re sending newsletters out you want to make sure you’re sharing something that is valuable to the person receiving it."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"There are dozens of platforms you can use to start a mailing list and they all have their benefits and downfalls. If you use Twitter, Revue is a great option that can even be embedded right on your Twitter profile. A lot of these platforms are very business and sales focused but don’t let that deter you! You’re simply collecting emails so that you can share when you’re opening commissions, looking for work, or making big changes in your life and you want to share them with your biggest fans, peers, and followers."}]}],"categories":[{"title":"Blog"}],"mainImage":null}},{"node":{"title":"DALL·E 2, it’s not the end for artists","publishedAt":"2022-06-13T21:27:00.000Z","preview":"It’s not the end, we promise.

Anyone who appreciates the process, journey, connection, and storytelling within an artists work will continue to do so and many people who are aware of DALL·E 2 will find it difficult to connect to a piece of work knowing that it is not something explicitly created by an artist. Regardless, it is up to the consumer to understand and choose what creatives and what creative processes they are supporting."}]},{"children":[]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"Overall, DALL·E 2 is just another tool that artists will be able to use to create artwork. Artists will be able to use this tool to generate a piece of artwork with a rough outline of what they might want, download that, and import it into their tools for refinement. In concept design and illustration work many of the important aspects are in the details. Nothing is wrong with starting your drawing with an AI generated image before adding more details and storytelling elements on top. DALL·E 2 will change how people create artwork online and artistic processes will continue to adapt with these changes. The only thing you can do is decide whether or not it benefits your creative process and whether or not you would like to use it to express yourself, tell stories, and connect with others."}]}],"categories":[{"title":"Blog"}],"mainImage":null}},{"node":{"title":"Artist only platforms aren’t the solution","publishedAt":"2022-06-13T18:10:00.000Z","preview":"Artists as a whole aren’t making money if they’re only getting paid by other artists.

They also follow you and want to support your channel, because that’s what friends do, so they subscribe for $5 and Twitch takes $2.50 off the top. Now you’ve both lost $2.50 and Twitch has made $5.00. Creators generally hangout together and love supporting each other so this happens a lot.

As we grow our objective is to both build a platform that supports creators and also to focus on building an audience with people who just want to support artists.

The purpose of this is because popular posts, often measured by how much of an emotional response they can cause, are designed to sell things and to keep people active on the platform. Our emotions influence our buying behaviors and these platforms know that. Algorithmic platforms like twitter, instagram, and facebook make revenue off advertisements. Companies pay them money to showcase ads that hopefully sell their products and this only works if in fact the ads do sell products so the social media platforms have to be pretty good at it. One of the methods these platforms use is rewarding consistently posting accounts."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"One of the biggest gripes people have with social media is how often you have to post in order to be seen. Posts that are made from consistently posting accounts are more likely to connect with their audience which in tern is more likely to keep people emotionally invested. If a stranger, or even better a bot, posted a controversial post or something that resonates with you, you’re far less likely to react to it. But if someone you follow who posts multiple times a day and who you feel like you connect with posts something similar then you’re way more likely to be emotionally invested, "},{"marks":["em"],"text":"and then maybe buy something after."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"Many discussions between artists talking about the algorithm talk about “fighting the algorithm\". When artists talk about fighting the algorithm they’re talking about how tough that struggle is to post frequently day in and day out and the disheartening feeling of posting something they love only to receive a handful of likes because the algorithm dubs their account unfavorable to showcase. On the other hand, this might be a tough pill to swallow, but you also shouldn’t expect to receive tonnes of attention on these platforms if you’re still just starting out as an artist. Not every beginner artist can or will receive a lot of attention for their work."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"This doesn’t mean that artists just starting out don’t deserve attention though. It’s important to cultivate communities and connection with other artists so you can learn from and inspire each other. It’s just these algorithm based platforms suck at enabling that. Have you ever started to get to know someone on one of these platforms only for the platform to what feels like suddenly decide you don’t want to see your posts? Perhaps once day you think, hey what happened to them and when you check their account you find out they’ve been posting regularly but you haven’t seen any of their posts. Once again, these platforms aren’t designed to enable connection. One might argue that they are designed to find new people but after that it’s left in your hands to find other means to further build that connection."}]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":""}]},{"children":[{"marks":["strong"],"text":"In an increasingly remote world, online platforms should ideally be designed to foster connection rather than to feed people “popular” posts that sell ads and that often drive people further apart."}]},{"children":[]},{"children":[{"marks":[],"text":"Where are artists supposed to go to share their work, meet fellow creators, and to build connections and community with other creators?
