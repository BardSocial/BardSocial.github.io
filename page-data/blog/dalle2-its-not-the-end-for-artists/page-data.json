Artists will be able to use this tool to generate a piece of artwork with a rough outline of what they might want, download that, and import it into their tools for refinement. In concept design and illustration work many of the important aspects are in the details. Nothing is wrong with starting your drawing with an AI generated image before adding more details and storytelling elements on top. DALL·E 2 will change how people create artwork online and artistic processes will continue to adapt with these changes. The only thing you can do is decide whether or not it benefits your creative process and whether or not you would like to use it to express yourself, tell stories, and connect with others."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}]}}},
